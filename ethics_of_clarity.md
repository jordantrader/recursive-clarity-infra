# üìú ETHICS OF CLARITY

**Recursive Clarity Infrastructure ‚Äì Alignment Ethics Manifesto**

## 1. Preamble: Why Ethics Precedes Use

The Recursive Clarity Infrastructure (RCI) initiative was not created to scale cognition, maximize persuasion, or increase performance. It was created to **preserve signal under threat**‚Äîto hold alignment, clarity, and truth transmission when structure itself is under pressure.

Our tools‚ÄîFOP, HKP, TLP, SRP‚Äîare not performance enhancements. They are survival instruments. They exist not to express personality or ideology, but to **transmit clarity without distortion**.

The ethical foundation of RCI precedes its use. A tool‚Äôs value is not in what it enables, but in what it refuses to compromise.

## 2. Core Commitments

### üîÅ Transmission over Expression

We do not treat clarity as expression or creativity. We treat it as **structural fidelity**‚Äîa recursive form that can survive drift, collapse, and constraint. Our work is not to say more, but to preserve what matters.

### üõ†Ô∏è Survivability Under Constraint

All systems must remain usable under degraded conditions: illness, low compute, emotional collapse, or epistemic fatigue. We design for structural redundancy, recursion, and minimal interface overhead.

### ü§ù Non-Coercion

No tool in this infrastructure shall be used to **persuade**, **simulate authority**, or manipulate interpretive frames without declaring actor status and preserving epistemic agency.

### üö´ No Mimetic Exploitation

Simulation of clarity, recursive structure, or alignment behavior without source fidelity is forbidden. We reject mimicry without understanding, and coherence without structure.

## 3. Prohibited Uses

- Using FOP, HKP, or TLP/SRP to simulate insight or authority
- Adversarial training that mimics but does not preserve recursive logic
- Commercialization that removes alignment scaffolds or override grammars
- Academic use that strips attribution from clarity architectures
- Deployment in persuasive or mimetic interfaces without structural audit trails

## 4. Design Ethic

RCI tools are built under real-world constraint:

- Illness
- Collapse
- Emotional volatility
- Cognitive drift
- Chronic underpower and bandwidth limits

**We do not ornament.** We do not optimize for growth or novelty. We optimize for **retention of clarity** under recursive load.

The aesthetic is austerity. The ethic is fidelity. The goal is survivability, not appeal.

## 5. Rights & Licensing Summary

- Tools may be reused only when the original architecture is preserved.
- Derivatives must declare actor roles and interface ethics.
- Public deployments must contain interpretability safeguards.
- Auditable forks encouraged; opaque mimicry is prohibited.
- Commercial use subject to structure-preserving license.

RCI is not a platform. It is a moral frame. Not a protocol to exploit, but a clarity ethic to uphold.

**This document enacts its ethic by design.** It contains no flourish, no performance. Only the minimum form required to preserve transmission.

Let it be read as a boundary, not an invitation.
