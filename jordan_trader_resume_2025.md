## üéØ Summary

Architect of epistemic infrastructure and interpretability tools. Focused on alignment safety, structural clarity, and high-fidelity transmission. Creator of semantic artifacts including override grammars, diagnostic maps, and recursive serialization protocols for model-grounded reasoning. Currently developing transmission-grade toolchains for structured cognition and drift-resistant understanding.

## üß† Core Projects

### 1. **Framing Override Protocol (FOP)**
Modular override grammar and control protocol for model reasoning. Enables recursive stance injection, alignment presets, and reflective audit trails using a composable command set.

### 2. **Human Knowledge Project (HKP)**
Serialization framework for structured knowledge. Features YAML-based corpus architecture, override grammars, anchor nodes, and subdomain diagnostics for fidelity-preserving transmission.

### 3. **Comparative Alignment Scale (CAS)**
Diagnostic system for mapping signal clarity and alignment integrity. Applies tiered scoring to model outputs and cultural artifacts using formalized transmission metrics.

### 4. **ThoughtLoop**
CLI-based belief audit and reframing tool for recursive debugging and epistemic trace recovery. Integrates stance logic and override grammars for internal alignment calibration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Context

- Primary strengths: structural design, epistemic modeling, clarity-centric architecture, documentation  
- Technical background: Python, SQL, LSTM-based modeling (archived), Reddit ETL pipelines  
- Research background: Information Retrieval: conversational search (University of Tsukuba, incomplete)  
- Current constraints: not available for high-bandwidth coding roles; focused on tool design, artifact logic, and epistemic alignment interfaces
