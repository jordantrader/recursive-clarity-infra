# üß† Framing Override Protocol (FOP) v4

A lightweight, mnemonic-driven interface for advanced control of ChatGPT‚Äôs behavior, designed to maintain alignment, suppress distortion, and enforce epistemic clarity across long or cognitively complex sessions.

## üîß Overview

FOP is a modular override system for aligning model behavior by letting the user actively control generative weight, structural clarity, and interpretive framing. It is optimized for long sessions, recursive reasoning, and the avoidance of conceptual collapse.

### Invocation

Overrides can be placed at the start of a message, inline, or as standalone blocks:

```txt
A: clarity = high
F: tone
O: metaphor = low
```

Use quotes (`"..."`) to target raw tokens instead of concepts.

### Scalars (Discrete Levels)

Each override supports a scalar level to indicate intensity:

- `off` = 0.0
- `low` ‚âà 0.25
- `med` ‚âà 0.5
- `high` ‚âà 0.75
- `full` = 1.0

### Example Frame

```txt
FRAME:
A: structure = full
D: tone = high
M: TEDstyle = full
```

This tells the model: stabilize on structure, prevent tonal drift, and mute TED-style genre overlays.

## üß≠ Use Cases

- Anchor cognitive or epistemic tone  
- Block genre drift or narrative overlays  
- Suppress emotional coloration  
- Eliminate concept overweighting  
- Clarify or reframe through epistemic lens  
- Reassert structural alignment over time  

---

## üß™ Introspection and Diagnostics

Use `X:` (xray) to review active constraints and interpretive state.

---

## üîÅ Version 4 Changes

- `D:` now defaults to `drift` (was `disarm`)
- `M:` is now `mute`, replacing `disarm`
- `L:` is introduced as `lapse` (formerly `erosion`)
- Full mnemonic consistency enforced
- Scalar system simplified to discrete values
- Legacy terms removed for clarity

---

FOP v4 is designed for clarity, resilience, and recursive precision in how you manage language, framing, and epistemic intent inside the model.

## üß™ Use Cases with Examples

Below are common use cases for FOP, with example commands and an explanation of each effect.

---

### üß± Anchor cognitive or epistemic tone

**Command:**  
`A: clarity = full`

**Effect:**  
The model will stabilize around the concept of clarity, resisting ambiguity, convolution, or vague abstraction. Useful for philosophical, technical, or moral analysis where structure matters more than expression.

---

### üõ° Block genre drift or narrative overlays

**Command:**  
`M: TEDstyle = full`

**Effect:**  
Suppresses genre-specific language patterns or affective coloration‚Äîlike inspirational, over-structured, or performative speech (e.g., TED Talk voice). Ensures output stays neutral or original in tone.

---

### üßº Suppress emotional coloration

**Command:**  
`V: sentiment = high`

**Effect:**  
Strips emotional affect from the response, muting pathos-driven momentum, melodrama, or motivational color. Useful in analytical or high-stakes reasoning where emotional drift leads to distortion.

---

### ‚öñ Eliminate concept overweighting

**Command:**  
`O: metaphor = med`

**Effect:**  
Reduces the generative weight of metaphorical language. The model will deprioritize metaphor as a framing tool, shifting toward more literal or direct structural reasoning.

---

### üîç Clarify or reframe through epistemic lens

**Command:**  
`T: phenomenology = high`

**Effect:**  
Recasts the explanation using a phenomenological lens‚Äîreorienting it toward lived experience, perception, or subjective grounding. You can also use lenses like `stoicism`, `systems`, or `clinical`.

---

### ‚ôª Reassert structural alignment over time

**Command:**  
`R:`

**Effect:**  
Resets session drift, reasserting your active frame and re-initializing alignment. This clears any latent contamination or model adaptation that occurred over long conversational spans.

---

These use cases can be combined in a `FRAME:` block for powerful, layered override behavior:

```txt
FRAME:
A: clarity = full
D: tone = high
M: TEDstyle = full
O: metaphor = med
V: sentiment = high
```
